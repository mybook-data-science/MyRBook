# (PART) Use R for Data Science  {-}

After learning about the various functions of R and how they can be used in the previous two chapters, this chapter of the book focuses on how R can be and is used for data science. 

# Introduction to Data Science {#introduction}

In general, Data Science can be described as the overlap of computer science and IT, mathematics and statistics as well as domains and business knowledge. Data Science uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge. In this case, the focus lies on structured and unstructured data. It uses the above-mentioned methods to solve a variety of problems. It is of great importance to understand a set of data as well as to structure and analyze this data. 

One of the most efficient ways to conduct data science is the use of the programing language R. Due to the fact that many people study R programming during their academic years based on the fact that it is legally free available, R is a well-known tool for data science with many people having at least basic knowledge in the coding language. The huge amount of complex data that is usually processed in data science makes it difficult to structure and conduct data for further analysis. R therefore offers a number of packages that can be used to for reading various forms of data into R, which are explained in detail in the `tidyverse` chapter.

## Data Science = Artificial intelligence - Yes or No?

Artificial Intelligence can generally be seen as intelligence that is demonstrated by machines. Machine learning as part of artificial intelligence enables IT systems to recognize patterns and laws on the basis of existing data and algorithms and to develop solutions.

Additionally, R offers the opportunity to train the algorithm and therefore offers the opportunity to bring in automation for future predictions. R makes machine learning a lot easier and more approachable with the number of packages available especially for machine learning. In conclusion, due to the fact that data science uses statistical learning algorithms such as machine learning, data science can be seen as artificial intelligence. The fact that, broadly speaking, machine learning connects data science and AI, leads to the conclusion that data science and AI can complement each other perfectly. 

## R for Data Data Science

In this chapter of the book, we will discuss data science in the form of conditions, subsets, vectorized functions, plots, loops, functions and scopes.
